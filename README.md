This repository provides analytical tools for investigating the momentum distribution of nucleons within a deuteron as well as the momentum distribution of the N\*(1535) resonance within the <sup>3</sup>He nucleus.

It uses different nucleon-nucleon interaction models, specifically the Paris [[1](<https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(81)90659-6>)] and the charge-dependent Bonn (CD-Bonn) [[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.63.024001)] potentials, to calculate and visually represent the nucleon momentum distribution in a deuteron. The process is streamlined by the software automatically processing model parameters provided in a JSON configuration file, resulting in both numerical data and graphical representations of the momentum distributions.

Additionally, the repository includes the tool for graphical representation of the momentum distribution of the N\* resonance within the <sup>3</sup>He nucleus, considered as a bound system of the resonance and a deuteron. This analysis is based on the theoretical work of Kelkar _et al._ [[3](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218301319500666)], [[4](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2020.121698)], in which the N\* momentum distribution is evaluated for various sets of coupling constants corresponding to binding energies E<sub>N\*-d</sub> = -0.33, -0.53, and -0.74 MeV. Comparing these distributions with the proton momentum distribution in <sup>3</sup>He yields insights into exotic nuclear states' structure and dynamics.

## Key Features

-   **Deuteron Analysis:** Uses Paris [[1](<https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(81)90659-6>)] and CD-Bonn [[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.63.024001)] nucleon-nucleon potentials for calculations of nucleon momentum distribution in a deuteron, derived from parameters specified in a JSON configuration file.
-   **N\*(1535) Resonance in <sup>3</sup>He:** The tool converts N\* momentum values from fm<sup>-1</sup> to GeV/c and normalises the distribution, facilitating the visualisation of the N\* momentum distribution within the <sup>3</sup>He nucleus. Additionally, it provides comparative visualisations of proton momentum distributions in <sup>3</sup>He.

## Software Dependencies

The codebase is built upon the [ROOT](https://root.cern) data analysis framework, renowned for its powerful processing and visualisation capabilities in particle physics and beyond.
Additionally, the project includes the `json.hpp` header from the [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library, located in the `include` directory for JSON parsing.

## Environment Setup

Before compiling and running the application, ensure that the `ROOTSYS` environment variable is correctly set to the ROOT framework's installation directory.

## Compilation and Execution

To build and execute the calculations, execute the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/alex-nuclearboy/nucleon-momentum-distribution.git

# Navigate to the repository directory
cd nucleon-momentum-distribution

# Create a build directory and navigate into it
mkdir build && cd build

# Use CMake to configure and build the project:
cmake .. && make

# Return to the project root directory
cd ..

# Execute the generated binaries
./deuteron_momentum_distribution
./helium_momentum_distribution
```

## Outputs

The software produces text files detailing nucleon momentum distributions in a deuteron and text files with the N\* resonance's momentum distributions in <sup>3</sup>He, converted from from fm<sup>-1</sup> to GeV/ and normalised. These files are saved in the `data` folder. Graphical outputs are stored as images in the `plots` folder.
